# DiseaseDetector
 A disease prediction application using Machine Learning model. Variety of ML Algorithms, implemented in Python, will be used to detect the presence of diseases in a patient. This good data driven system can improve the entire research and disease prevention process so that people can lead healthy lives. The application demands input from the user in the form of three symptoms to then predict the user's disease. 

We have used Anvil to implement the code on a web application.
